            </div>
            <p>
                Finding time to train your body in whatever way works for you is an essential component to wellness. Humans have evolved into the dynamic beings we are because of the demands we’ve made on our bodies throughout history. When we deny ourselves the movement critical to our longstanding survival, the results are often painful and limiting.
            </p>
            <p>
                This advantageous change in anatomy came with a brilliant brain to match and exercising it is no less important to our overall wellbeing. There are many ways to train your mind, one such being mindful breathing.
            </p>
            <p class="recs">
                We breathe without thought – fast or slow – it is a continuous reflex. When we practice mindful breathing, you take measured breaths and may or may not hold for controlled periods of time. There are many different types and the benefits are nothing short of amazing. Mindful breathing has been shown to reduce anxiety and depression, improve focus, and may even help <a href="https://psychcentral.com/health/mindful-breathing?c=468606724299#benefits" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to PsychCentral's article about the benefits of breathing techniques (opens in a new tab)."> lower blood pressure</a>.

                <h3>Box-Breathing</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="recs">
                One breathing technique has been shown to calm the nervous system and increase focus and it is called <a href="https://www.webmd.com/balance/what-is-box-breathing" target="_blank" aria-label="Go to WebMD's article about box breathing (opens in a new tab).">box-breathing</a>, or square breathing. Practicing this technique will help you to breathe deeply on more regularly which can help you to relax overall.
            </p>
            <p>
                To begin, ensure you’re somewhere you can relax and focus, in a chair or lying down. Place one hand on your chest and one on your stomach. Ensure you are breathing deeply by paying attention to whether your stomach rises and falls. If it does not, take the time to adjust your breathing so that each breath pushes your stomach out. Then, begin breathing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Breathe in for four seconds.
                <br>
                Hold for four seconds.
                <br>
                Breathe out for four seconds.
                <br>
                Hold for four seconds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each breath should be an act of mindfulness, pay attention and allow your mind to center on how you feel in that very moment as each one begins and ends. Try this technique (or any mindful breathing) for 30 seconds when you feel overwhelmed, when you’re stressed, or when you have a few minutes of peace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below is a visual that will help you keep track of step in box-breathing so that your focus can be on yourself and in the moment.
