                        Wellness is contemporary word for an ancient concept. Known by many names throughout history, it is a holisitc approach wherein good health is the balance of proper diet, frequent exercise, and mental wellbeing. In order to thrive in the modern world, many of us have become increasingly disconnected from our health. We are complex beings who require care that addresses the mind, the spirit and the body as a whole.

                    Have you ever heard the old adage, “You are what you eat”? What you consume dictates the quality of your health. A diet consisting of processed foods high in sodium and sugar while low in nutrients steals energy and longevity from our future selves and prevents satiety of body and mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Incorporating fresh, whole foods and spending time in the kitchen are a part of a balanced diet but don’t discount the importance of the small steps it takes to build a foundation. Sustainability is key in achieving proper wellness. Begin with a vegetarian or vegan meal once a week. Choose a salad instead of a side of fries. Become knowledgeable about the ingredients in your pantry. If it cannot be recreated in a standard kitchen, is it still something you would like to munch on?
                </p>
                <P>
                    Small steps will still take you to the next level bringing you that much closer to wellness.

                    Most people know how to exercise the body, whether or not we are able to find time to do so. Going for a walk or a run, lifting weights, taking a yoga class, or anything that gets you moving will help you keep your body in shape.

                How many times a week do you exercise your mind? For many of us, anxiety and stress are a way of life but that can lead to exhaustion, burn out, or even disease. Taking time to exercise the mind can alleviate some of that unavoidable stress and can be done without any special equipment.
