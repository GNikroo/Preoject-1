                    Wellness is contemporary word for an ancient concept. Known by many names throughout history, it is a holisitc approach wherein good health is the balance of proper diet, frequent exercise, and mental wellbeing. In order to thrive in the modern world, many of us have become increasingly disconnected from our health. We are complex beings who require care that addresses the mind, the spirit and the body as a whole.

        <h2>Food for Wellness</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever heard the old adage, “You are what you eat”? What you consume dictates the quality of your health. A diet consisting of processed foods high in sodium and sugar while low in nutrients steals energy and longevity from our future selves and prevents satiety of body and mind.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fresh, whole foods are a part of a balanced diet but don’t discount the importance of the small steps it takes to build its foundation. Sustainability is key in achieving proper wellness. Begin with a vegetarian or vegan meal once a week. Choose a salad instead of the side of fries. Become knowledgeable about the ingredients in your pantry. If it cannot be recreated in a standard kitchen, is it still something you would like to munch on?
        </p>
        <P>
            Small steps will still take you to the next level bringing you that much closer to wellness. 
        </P>
