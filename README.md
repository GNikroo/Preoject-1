The first few iterations of this website included code from a project I built while following along with the tutorial at Code Institute. It was not my code but I used it for both reference and inspiration as this project is my very first from the ground up. Because I have never worked with git, the idea of committing and pushing code was very new and I didnâ€™t really think about what it was exactly I was pushing. At some point, you might see that I commented-out the code as I realized this unrelated information would show up in the history. I immediately remembered you should not push commented-out code so I removed it completely and it is now missing. Of course, I understand this is not best practice and have taken it as a learning moment that will influence what I commit/push in the future. 

 
 

box breathing visual - When researching how to include a breathing exercise, I found animations on W3Schools. After becoming more familiar with the property I was advised to look into transform properties instead as a more efficient tool. I understand that animation uses more memory, however I felt I understood it better and so I have opted to use it and research transform for future use.
