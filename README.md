# Project 1 - Wellness
I wanted to create a website focused on wellness as it is a very recent and personal interest of mine. I have learned some self-care tips and wanted to compile them in a single place for anyone who would be interested in the topic. In order to share the information in an eye-catching way, I did need to go beyong the HTML and CSS essentials module I have completed at Code Institute. Mainly, I learned a lot about the use of flexboxes and animation. I've also discovered the importance of setting universal parameters and html font size (rem is my favorite thing at the moment). 


### Box-breathing Animation
When researching how to include a breathing exercise, I found animations on W3Schools. After becoming more familiar with the property I was advised to look into transform properties instead as a more efficient tool. I understand that animation uses more memory, however I felt I understood it better and so I have opted to use it and research transform for future use. 

## Credits
W3Schools has been invaluable in expanding on topics I knew as well as having no knowledge in. Namely, introducing me to concepts of animation and flexbox.

CSS Tricks offered a very in depth description of flex including visual aides which really solidified my understanding.

Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy offers a course on CSS that has been the perfect supplement to Code Institute and his desctriptions of how to use universal and html selectors helped me refine my code. I finally understand rem and how important of a tool it actual is in responsive design.

Freecodecamp has a great page on how to write up a meaningful README.md that I've used as reference so hopefully I've done it justice!

The first few iterations of this website included code from a project I built while following along with the tutorial at Code Institute. It was not my code but I used it for both reference and inspiration (sometimes even as stand-in code) as this project is my very first from the ground up. Because I have never worked with git, the idea of committing and pushing code was very new and I didnâ€™t really think about what it was exactly I was pushing. At some point, you might see that I commented-out the code as I realized this unrelated information would show up in the history. I immediately remembered you should not push commented-out code so I removed it completely and it is now missing. Of course, I understand this is not best practice and have taken it as a learning moment that will influence what I commit/push in the future.

#### I hope you enjoy my project!
